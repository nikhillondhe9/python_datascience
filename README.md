## Python Data Science
This repository holds data science projects I have done using multiple python Data Science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

** I have also included a jupyter notebook of each project within the respective project directory, which is the more preferable way to view the project **

## How to run the code (python file)
You will need Python set up on your system, preferably V3.5 or higher, and an IDE like PyCharm, IDLE or similar. Also you will need to install Numpy and Pandas libraries.

Clone the repository on your local machine.

Open the cloned project within your IDE.

Run the app.py file.

You should be able to see the output in the terminal below.

## How to run the code (jupyter notebook)
For this you will need to have jupyter notebook installed on your system, one of the easiest and recommended way is to install anaconda distribution, which has jupyter notebook within.

once Jupyter notebook is set up, use terminal (on Mac or Linux) or anaconda prompt(on windows) to navigate to the location where the python notebook is on your system and run command 'jupyter notebook'

if everything goes alright a new browser window should open up with jupyter notebook running on your local host

click the notebook in the browser window, and you should be ready to go


**Modify the code to analyze the data set even further or as per your needs**
